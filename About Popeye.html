  <p><strong>Popeye</strong> the <b>Sailor Man</b> is a fictional cartoon character created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._C._Segar"><b>Elzie Crisler Segar</b></a>.
    The character first appeared in the daily <em>King Features comic</em> strip <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye#Thimble_Theatre_and_Popeye_comic_strips"><b>Thimble Theatre</b></a> on January 17, 1929, and Popeye
    became the strip's title in later years. The character has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons.</p><br>
  <h2 align="center">Fictional character and story</h2>
  <p>Popeye's story and characterization vary depending on the medium. Originally, Popeye got "luck" from rubbing the
    head of the Whiffle Hen; by 1932, he was instead getting "strength" from eating spinach. Swee'Pea is Popeye's
    ward in the comic strips, but he is often depicted as belonging to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Oyl"><strong>Olive Oyl</strong></a> in cartoons.</p><br>
  <p>There is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, although certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant,
    including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Popeye seems bereft of manners and uneducated, yet he often comes up
    with solutions to problems that seem insurmountable to the police or the scientific community. He has displayed Sherlock Holmes-like
    investigative prowess, scientific ingenuity, and successful diplomatic arguments. In the animated cartoons his pipe also proves to be
    highly versatile. Among other things, it has served as a cutting torch, jet engine, propeller, periscope, musical instrument, and a
    whistle with which he produces his trademark toot. He also eats spinach through his pipe, sometimes sucking in the can along with the
    contents. Since the 1970s, Popeye is seldom depicted using his pipe to smoke tobacco.</p><br>
  <p>Popeye's exploits are also enhanced by a few recurring plot elements. One is the love triangle among Popeye, Olive,
    and Bluto, and Bluto's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his near-saintly perseverance
    in overcoming any obstacle to please Olive, who often (if temporarily) renounces Popeye for Bluto.</p><br>
